In this document, we presented our implementation for the square root and inverse square root operations for bfloat16 numbers. We introduced the problem setting and the mathematical background, and then we presented our implementation. We finally validated our work using a test-bench, and confronting our results with the ones provided by the square root implementation of the C language. The results confirmed the correctness of our code, and also its successful integration with the already developed modules. 

Therefore, as a conclusion, we affirm to have reached all the goals for the project.
